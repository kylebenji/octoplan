# Octoplan, the task management app for when you need 8 more arms

Octoplan is a to-do list app that I am creating as practice using React-Redux to create responsive and reactive web applications using a state management system.

## Current functionality:

- Creating tasks with dates, times, notes, and a priority systems
- Editing previously created tasks
- Task Deletion
- Daily summary
  - Weather using Open-Meteo
  - Total tasks for the day
- Task filters
- Sorting (date, priority, etc.)
- Tasks, filters, and sorting are saved to LocalStorage so you can continue where you left off when you return.

## Future Functionality

- user settings
- sub-tasks that can nest
- specific task times
- Task Categories

## Technologies

Octoplan uses a variety of tech in its code, including:

- React and accompanying libraries
- Redux
- Bootstrap
- SASS
- React Select
