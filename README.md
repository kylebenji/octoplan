# Octoplan, the task management app for when you need 8 more arms

Octoplan is a to-do list app that I am creating as practice using React-Redux to create responsive and reactive web applications using a state management system. Currently I am still working on extending basic functionality and getting the styling where I want it, but in the future I am planning on adding task filters and other advanced features (sub-tasks, times, sorting, etc.).

## Technologies

Octoplan uses a variety of tech in its code, including:

- React and accompanying libraries
- Redux
- Bootstrap
- SASS

## Current functionality:

- Creating tasks with dates, times, notes, and a priority systems
- Editing previously created tasks
- Task Deletion

## Future Functionality

- Daily summary
  - Weather
  - Total tasks for the day
  - If this were to ever integrate with a calendar this would be a great place for it
- Task filters
- Sorting (date, priority, etc.)
- sub-tasks
- specific task times
- Task Categories
